                <dt>Question: Our dog, Sparky, likes to eat whatever the kids are snaking on. <br/>
                    Is it OK for the dog to eat chocolate?</dt>
                <dd>Answer: Chocolate is toxic to dogs.  Please do not feed you dog chocolate. Try playing a game with your children -- when you feed people treats, they can feed Sparky dog treats.</dd>
