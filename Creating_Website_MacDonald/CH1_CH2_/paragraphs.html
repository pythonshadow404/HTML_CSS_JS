    <!-- You should get into the habit of thinking of the text in your web pages as a series 
        of paragraphs. In other words, before you type in any text, add the <p> and </p> tags 
        to serve as a container. Most of the time, paragraphs are the first level of 
        structure you add to a page. -->
