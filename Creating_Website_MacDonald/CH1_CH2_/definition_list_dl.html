    <!--Definition lists use a slightly different tagging system than 
        ordered and unordered lists. First, you wrap the whole list in 
        a dictionary list element (<dl>). Then you wrap each term in 
        a <dt> element (dictionary term), and each definition in 
        a <dd> element (dictionary definition).-->

        <p>Definition lists are perfect for creating your own online glossary. 
        Each list item consists of two parts, a term (which the browser doesnâ€™t indent) 
        and a definition (which the browser indents underneath the term).</p>
